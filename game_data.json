In lean, logical staments live in a \nworld called `Prop`. So for example if we write `P : Prop` we mean \"$P$ is a logical statement.\" \nThink of the `:` symbol as saying $P$  is a resident of `Prop` world (in maths this would be denoted\nby something like `P \u2208 Prop`).\n\n#Truth Values\n\nThe truth value of a logical statement (i.e. some `P : Prop`) is whether the statement is true or \nfalse.  For example, the truth value of the statement: \"For all integers $x \u2208 \u2124$,  $0 \u2264 x^2$\" \nis *true* while  \"For all integers $x \u2208 \u2124$,  $0 \u2264 x^3$\" is *false*. \n\nIn lean we assign truth values as follows: We first think of a proposition $P$ as a set with \n*at most* one element.  If this set is empty, then we say `P` is *false*. Otherwise, if this set has \nan element, lets call it $p$ (we will usually use upper case letters for logical statements, \nand lower case for their proofs), then this  statement is *true* and $p$ is the proof. \n\nSo to recap, if $P$ is the true/false statement (the statement of proposition), and $p$ is its proof.\nIt's like thinking $P$ being the set and $p$ being the element. Just as above, where we had \n`P : Prop` to mean $P$  is a proposition, we write `p : P` to mean \"$p$ is a proof of $P$\".\n\nThe aim of this game is to learn how to manipulate logical statements and their proofs. \nLets start with a super basic example of how a lemma looks like in lean.\n\nThis is where the window on the right will come into play.
