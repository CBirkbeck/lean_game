"## By the Barcelona Lean Seminar\n"

"Learn topology with Lean!\n"

"# What is this game?\n"
"\n"
"In this game, you will learn topology and Lean at the same time. Travel "
"through different worlds solving challenges. On the left side \n"
"of the screen you will find tactics and theorems you can use.\n"
"\n"
"Have fun!\n"

"# Credits\n"

"## Summary\n"
"\n"
"`refl` is a tactic which proves goals of the form `X = X`.\n"
"\n"
"## Details\n"
"\n"
"The `refl` tactic will close any goal of the form `A = B`\n"
"where `A` and `B` are *exactly the same thing*.\n"
"\n"
"### Example:\n"
"If it looks like this in the top right hand box:\n"
"```\n"
"A B : set X\n"
"⊢ A ∪ B = A ∪ B\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"then\n"
"\n"
"`refl,`\n"
"\n"
"will close the goal and solve the level. Don't forget the comma.\n"
